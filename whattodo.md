If the game won't start initially here's what to do:
-----------------------------------------------------
Remove the ***dsound.dll*** from the **game executable folder**
 
For me it's this folder, I've got the GOG version:
 
***D:\Games\The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt\bin\x64\***

It would be different depending on if you have it installed through steam or which directory you
installed it in, but the directory structure is the same once you get into the ***The Witcher 3*** top folder
 
I just moved it into the ***D:\Games\The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt\bin\x64\plugins*** folder
 
Without the ***dsound.dll*** in that directory the game should load.
 
Load a save then exit out of the game and put ***dsound.dll*** back into 
the 
***The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt\bin\x64\*** folder and try again
